## Reservoir Sampling

VTK now includes an implementation of reservoir sampling.
Reservoir sampling is fast algorithm for choosing a random,
fixed-size subset of a potentially large integer sequence
(such as array indices, cell IDs, point IDs, etc).

See `Common/Math/vtkReservoirSampler.h` for details.
